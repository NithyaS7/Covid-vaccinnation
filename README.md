# Covid-vaccinnation

The aim of this project is to analyze the data of covid vaccination and deriving meaningful insights from it.

Introduction:

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic unmasked the many flaws that healthcare systems faced worldwide.

The data set contains 974281 rows &16 columns about 222 countries.

The dataset is available from 2020 to 2021

Problem Statement:

We can find out how many people are completely vaccinated.
Total vaccinations by each year and also by country. In this analysis, we can see the number of people vaccinated per hundred.
 Methodology:

Step 1: Data cleaning

The first step for any report is cleaning, so I cleaned the data with the transform data option in the Power BI because the dataset was not cleaned and included some missing values,

so with the help of the duplicates function in Power BI, I cleaned the data and replace the null values with 0 and then started working on it.

Then loaded the data.

Step 2: Data interpretation

In data interpretation, I found out some important information about the data.
•After cleaning, the data set is now almost clear.
• I have replaced the null values with 0.
• the dataset contains 974281 rows and 16 columns.

Its about total of 222countries vaccination data.
Totally 549 billion peoples are fully vaccinated.

2 Trillion people are vaccinated.

Step 3: Visualization

I have created map visualization to show the total vaccination by country.
In that Total Highest vaccination is 709bn in China.
Secondly india is vaccinated almost 323 bn people.
Created line charts for finding Month & year wise vaccination.

Observation

According to data on people fully vaccinated in the year.
The dataset contains data about from 2020 to 2021
Total vaccination by the country in map visualization.
Total Highest Daily vaccination is 3.25bn in china.
Total Highest vaccination is 709bn in China.
Highest number of vaccinations by the source name is the national Health commission 35%.
Second govt.of.India 16.15%
found top 10 countries with fully vaccinated:
Top 10 Daily vaccination in the countries:

 Recommendations
 
Picarium,T okelau, niue, folkland islands these are the 4 countries have least vaccination rate, we can suggest them the advantage of vaccination & create awareness.
National Health commission & India has almost 50% of vaccination source.
Will recommend them to help the least vaccination countries.

 Conclusion:-
 
In conclusion, we can take a look at the final Report for further analysis.
As we can see in the Report the top countries vaccination-wise, Top Country by the vaccination in daily and best top 10 countries with our vaccines. Vaccination peeks in 2022. The Top 2 vaccine sources are India, and China.
